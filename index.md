Hi!
I'm an aspiring mathematical geometer and PhD student at Stanford. Let's change it up!

## The site
This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/), [{% katex %}\KaTeX{% endkatex %}](https://katex.org/), and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 
If you're interested, you can see the source for the entire setup [here](https://github.com/henrybosch/henrybosch.github.io).
